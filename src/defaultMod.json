//Conclusion for the initial status of CP and CR for 4 areas
//CP Rank：1.A4     2.A1     3.A2      4.A3
//CR Rank：1.A3     2.A1     3.A2      4.A4
//The CR to CP transmission effiency Rank: 1.A4     2.A2     3.A1      4.A3

//P.S The CR to CP transmission effiency could be made significantly higher between A1 and A2 dur to the geographical adjacency.
