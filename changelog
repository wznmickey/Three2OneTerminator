==============================================================================

You are faced with four areas in chaos stricken by a horrible pandemic VOPID-141. 

Citizen's lives and urban resources are at stake!  The whole city is on the verge of destruction.

Appointed as the governor, it's your job to save as many lives as possible.

in the four districts with only limited amount of critical resources and control points.

 Control Points (CP) include the local index exclusive to each district which is the overall drop in health threat level of the virus, 

and the global CPs such as “External Safety”, “Citizen Trust” and “Disposable Money”. 

Different types of CP can generate a distinctive impact on one another, thereby rendering each district relatively safe or not.

The value Critical Resources (CR) demonstrates the maximum capacity of a district to offer material support to others

It are the only factor you can control to maintain the balance of CP.

Click on the yellow dots in the squares and click on another target district to transfer CR within the districts.

The effect on CP also differs from the origin and destination of CR.

Try to protect your CP as best as you can achieve highest drop in health threat! 

The game ends when you make any of the CP decrease to 0!

Good Luck. Now you will take over Gotham, Bombay, GassVilie and Burnley.
